This code supports the paper "Modeling high current events for solar inverters with subhourly data" by M. Zamora Zapata, K. Lappalainen, A. Kankiewicz, J. Kleissl (2023).

This work follows Ladd's article on Solar PRO regarding the NEC 1999 and NEC 2007 rules for inverter selection based on PV module output current. In this case, we use 1 min data from the SURFRAD network and see the differences for several PV configurations.
