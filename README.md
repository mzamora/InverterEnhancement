# InverterEnhancement
Effects of cloud irradiance enhancement on inverter's input variables (work in progress)

This work follows Ladd's article on Solar PRO regarding the NEC 1999 and NEC 2007 rules for inverter selection based on PV module output current. In this case, we use 1 min data from the SURFRAD network and see the differences for several PV configurations.
