This code supports the paper "Comparing solar inverter design rules to subhourly solar resource simulations" by MÃ³nica Zamora Zapata, Kari Lappalainen, Adam Kankiewicz, Jan Kleissl. Published in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy (2023).

This work follows Ladd's article on Solar PRO regarding the NEC 1999 and NEC 2007 rules for inverter selection based on PV module output current. In this case, we use 1 min data from the SURFRAD network and see the differences for several PV configurations.
